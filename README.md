# TrekPath
TrekPath is a sample app for visionOS, designed to explore SwiftUI (MapKit, Swift Charts, & Model3D) and RealityKit. 
It is based on a hiking trip I undertook during the summer of 2023 in the south of France. This project will showcase the hiking path, elevation, and a 3D Map Tile for each day.
